# OmniAuth Clef

The official Clef OAuth2 Strategy for OmniAuth 1.0.

For details on the client side authentication scheme for Clef, refer to the documentation at: http://docs.clef.io

## Installing

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth'
gem 'omniauth-clef'
```

Then `bundle install`.

## Usage

`OmniAuth::Strategies::Clef` is simply a Rack middleware. Read the OmniAuth 1.0 docs for detailed instructions: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth.

Here's a quick example, adding the middleware to a Rails app in `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :clef, ENV['CLEF_ID'], ENV['CLEF_SECRET']
end
```

### Custom Callback URL/Path

You can set a custom `callback_url` or `callback_path` option to override the default value. See [OmniAuth::Strategy#callback_url](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/blob/master/lib/omniauth/strategy.rb#L411) for more details on the default.

## Auth Hash

Here's an example *Auth Hash* available in `request.env['omniauth.auth']`:

```ruby
{
  :provider => 'clef',
  :uid => '1234567',
  :info => {
    :email => 'test@example.com',
    :first_name => 'Clef',
    :last_name => 'User',
    :phone_number => '2021119999'
  },
  :extra => {
    :raw_info => {
      :id => '1234567',
      :first_name => 'Clef',
      :last_name => 'User',
      :name => 'Clef User' # only included if first name is included
      :email => 'test@example.com',
      :phone_number => '2021119999'
    }
  }
}
```

## Supported Rubies

Actively tested with the following Ruby versions:

- MRI 1.9.3
- MRI 1.9.2
- MRI 1.8.7
- JRuby 1.6.5

*NB.* For JRuby, you'll need to install the `jruby-openssl` gem. There's no way to automatically specify this in a Rubygem gemspec, so you need to manually add it your project's own Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jruby-openssl', :platform => :jruby
```
